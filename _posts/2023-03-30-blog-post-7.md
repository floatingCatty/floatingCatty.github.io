deduction from many body electronic potential to hatree potential and exchange energy. https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Advanced_Theoretical_Chemistry_(Simons)/06%3A_Electronic_Structure/6.03%3A_The_Hartree-Fock_Approximation

So, what assumption is made in hatree fock? As in above notes says, hatree fock equation can be deduced with variational minimization of schrodinger equation with slater-determinant wave-function, so, the approximation must lies in the wave-function.
