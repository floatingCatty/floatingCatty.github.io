"The theory of fermions is one of the great triumphs of twentieth-century physics. Most of the credit belongs to Paul Dirac, who started, like Einstein, with some simple assumptions and laid the foundations for the Pauli exclusion principle of chemistry, Fermi statustucs ub sikuds, and antimatter in particle physics.""

The basic problem of Schrodinger equation is it doesn't contain relativistic effect, since if we wrote:
$$
\begin{align*}
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi=H\psi=\left[\frac{-\hbar^2\nabla^2}{2m}+U\right]\psi
\end{align*}$$
since the kinetic terms is not relativistically invariant, which is $E^2=(mc^2)^2+(cp)^2$. However, if the time derivitive term has second order. Then the equation will become like:
$$
\begin{align}
\left(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right)^2\psi&=-\hbar^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}\psi\\
&=\left[m^2c^4+c^2(-\hbar^2\nabla^2)\right]\psi\\
&=E^2\psi\\
\Leftrightarrow
-\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}\psi=\frac{m^2c^2}{\hbar^2}\psi-\nabla^2\psi
\end{align}
$$
The solution will looks like $\psi(x,t)=\psi_0\cos(\omega t)\cos(kx)$, which means particle can disappear if $\cos(\omega t)=0$. So "Dirac believed strongly the equation should be dependent in time linearly." (btw the above quadratic equation is known as Klein-Gordon equation.)

Dirac divided $$E^2-(mc^2)^2-|c\vec{p}|^2=(E+\alpha_0mc^2+c\vec{\alpha}\cdot\vec{p})(E-\alpha_0mc^2-c\vec{\alpha}\cdot\vec{p})=0$$
which can be done if $\{\alpha_i,\alpha_j\}=2\delta_{ij}$ is anticommutational. So Paili matrices is a natrual choice. Then we have _Dirac equation_: $$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi\rangle=H|\psi\rangle=(\alpha_0mc^2+c\vec{\alpha}\cdot\vec{p})|\psi\rangle$$
where 
$$
\alpha_0=
\left(
\begin{matrix}
E & 0 \\
0 & -E
\end{matrix}
\right), \quad
\alpha_i=
\left(
\begin{matrix}
0 & \sigma_i \\
\sigma_i & 0
\end{matrix}
\right)
$$
That $\sigma_i$ is Pauli spin matrices. This equation will have both positive an negative energy solution, which indicates _positrons_ in the _Dirac sea_.

**The Dirac equation and spin energies** Before we only includes the kinetic term in Hamiltonian, now we can add in the magnetic term and the electrostatic term, to see what happen.
Aware the conservative energy $$E^2=(mc^2)^2-|c\vec{\alpha}\cdot\vec{p}|^2.$$

To account for magnetic field, we can have a vector potential, and then:$E^2=(mc^2)^2+|c\vec{\alpha}\cdot(\vec{p}-q\vec{A})|^2$. Assume $|c\vec{\alpha}\cdot(\vec{p}-q\vec{A})|$ is comparably smaller than the first, we have $E=\sqrt{(mc^2)^2+(cp)^2}\approx mc^2+p^2/2m$, by $\alpha_x\alpha_y=i\sigma_z$ we have:$$\begin{align*}E^2&=(mc^2)^2+c^2|\vec{\alpha}\cdot(\vec{p}-q\vec{A})|^2\\&=(mc^2)^2+c^2\left|\sum_{i}\alpha_i(p_i-qA_i)\right|^2\\&=(mc^2)^2+c^2\left[\sum_{i}\alpha_i^2(p_i-qA_i)^2+\sum_{i\neq j}\alpha_i\alpha_j(p_i-qA_i)(p_j-qA_j)\right]\\&=(mc^2)^2+c^2|\vec{p}-q\vec{A}|^2+\hbar c^2\vec{\sigma}\cdot(\nabla\times\vec{A})\end{align*}$$We have then $E\approx mc^2+\frac{1}{2m}|\vec{p}-q\vec{A}|^2+\frac{q\hbar}{2m}\vec{\sigma}\cdot\vec{B}$.The first two terms correspond to the standard nonrelativistic Hamiltonian for a particle in a magnetic field, while the last term is a new term that arises from the fact that we needed to introduce the Î± matrices for the relativistic wave equation. 

Then we include a electrostatic field instead of the $\vec{A}$. We have $$E|\psi\rangle=\left(\alpha_0mc^2+c\vec{\alpha}\cdot\vec{p}+U(\vec{r})\right)|\psi\rangle$$
