_The present chapter is the first in a series of four Chapters (VI, VII, IX and X) devoted to the study of angular momenta in quantum mechanics. This is an extremely important problem, and the results we are going to establish are used in many domains of physics: the classification of atomic, molecular and nuclear spectra, the spin of elementary particles, magnetism, etc... - Quantum Mechanics Volume 1 (Cohen-Tannoudji)_

So I intended to intergrate informations in (VI,VII,IX and X) to gives a special note on Angular Momentum in Quantum Mechanics.
