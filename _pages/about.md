Hello, welcome about!
I am currently a post-graduate student in Tianjin University. My research interests are machine learning and its intersections with physics and quantum chemistry.

#### Specificly, my research interests include:

1. Accelerating atomic and electronic simulation with machine learning.
2. Integrating ab initio simulation methods across various levels (ranging from wave function approaches to semi-empirical models) through machine learning techniques.
3. Bridging ab initio calculations and experiments via modelling of intricate material systems, such as confined systems, heterogeneous interfaces, defects, etc.

Things Your can found here:
======
1. Some notes.
2. Summary and comments on recent papers.
3. Daily stories, comments about the news, history.\\
Blogs anyway ;)
4. ...
