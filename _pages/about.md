Things Your can found here:

1. Great strudy Notes about everything! \\
(currently, most of them are the studies record of physics and math and paper reading somethings if I found some very interesting ones.)

Mostly the AI and Application in Physics and Quantum Chemistry.
3. Opinions about the news, history and complains about the daily life.\\
