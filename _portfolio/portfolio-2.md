I primarily attended the experiment and characterization meeting during my time there. The meetings were quite productive, although it was unfortunate that I didn't have access to good food for those few days. The meeting venues were situated amidst numerous tech companies, causing the nearby dining spots to be consistently crowded with employees whenever I tried to grab a bite.

Fortunately, the quality of the meetings managed to outweigh the disappointment of the subpar meals.
