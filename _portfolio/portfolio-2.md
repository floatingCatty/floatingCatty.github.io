I went to the experiment and characterization meeting mainly. Meetings was great, but sadly I didn't have nice food that couple of days, since the places the meeting is hosted has a lot of tech companies around. So every time I want to have some food around, there always be crowded with the employees. 

Luckily the meetings is good enough to cover the sadness of poor meals.
