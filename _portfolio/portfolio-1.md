This year's CPS meeting finds its venue in Yinchuan, Ningxia, a name that directly translates to "silver river." Situated in the northwestern region of China, the city boasts an elevated altitude exceeding 1km. As a result, the weather presents an intriguing anomaly: in certain areas, the temperature remains refreshingly cool, inducing a sense of chill during summer mornings. However, the heightened altitude intensifies the sun's impact, creating a sensation akin to one's skin and hair being scorched upon direct exposure to sunlight. This contrast leads to a paradoxical scenario where shaded areas offer a comfortable coolness while the sun bathes the surroundings in searing heat.
