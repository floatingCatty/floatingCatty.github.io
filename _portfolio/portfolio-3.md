It is very enjoyable to walk in steets in Tianjin. The design of the whole city is based on the trend of the Haihe River. Since the river is not straight, the road, streat in Tianjin appears to be very diversified. It seldom have standard crossroad, instead, a three cross and five cross is more common. The city have its casualty, but is not chaotic. 

Some picture I took during walking.
