Walking through the streets of Tianjin is an immensely pleasurable experience. The city's layout draws inspiration from the meandering course of the Haihe River. As the river flows in gentle curves, the roads and streets of Tianjin exhibit a captivating diversity. Rather than conforming to conventional crossroad patterns, the city predominantly features charming intersections of three and five roads. Tianjin possesses a unique charm that exudes an air of casualness without descending into chaos.

Some picture I took during walking.
